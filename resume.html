        An Experimental Study on RHA and Natural Fiber Based on Geo-polymer Concrete
        
        •	Geo-polymer concrete is an environmentally friendly and economical building material. It is one of the alternatives to replace ordinary Portland cement concrete. As concrete is the most commonly used manmade material for construction of buildings, bridges, roads, dams etc. So, as an alter native to cement an environmental friendly cement substitute such as agricultural wastes, industrial wastes and rice husk ash can be used. By using RHA as a main material in geo polymer concrete it is possible to produce a sustainable concrete by reducing a emission of carbon dioxide.
